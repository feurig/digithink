# Nginx Server Build
I am looking at nginx to serve the static sites previously served by lighttpd (www.digithink.com, www.busholini.org) with encryption. Hopefully I can get it to autoupdate the certbot/letsencrypt certificates.

## Nginx install.
### Broke it the first try.
Nginx's debian package installs a default web server configuration which breaks if ipv6 is disabled. 
#### The broken.

```
Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status nginx.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
invoke-rc.d: initscript nginx, action "start" failed.

```

#### The fix.

```
root@guenter:/etc/nginx# nano sites-available/default 
... comment out the [::]:80 ....
        #listen [::]:80 default_server;
...
root@guenter:/etc/nginx# apt-get install certbot nginx

### Adding content from other server.
Now that we have a working server we give it some content.

#### Copy content from lighttpd server.

    root@guenter:/var/www# tar -xzvf www.tgz 

#### Named Virtual Hosts



```
# nano /etc/nginx/sites-avaliable/default

server {
        listen 80;
#       listen [::]:80;
        server_name www.digithink.com;
        root /var/www/digithink/site;
        index index.html;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

server {
        listen 80;
#       listen [::]:80;
        server_name www.busholini.org;
        root /var/www/busholini/www;
        index index.html;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

```

### Add Certificate from Lets Encrypt.

Even though this site is static and public we still want to add SSL to the site to prevent the content from being altered along the way.

#### Certbot work as advertized. 
The first couple of web pages I found on the web described the automagic creation and configuration of certificate and once I replaced python-certbot-nginx with python3-cerbot-nginx things actually went brilliantly.

```
root@guenter:/var/www# apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/digithink.com/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/digithink.com/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2021-08-06. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
